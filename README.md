In workout2, we created a shiny app that models three investment types - future value, annuity, and growing annuity. Changes in the initial amount, return rate, time period, annual contribution, and growth rate are calculated by the values of the sliders. The line graph is a graphical representation of the slider values. A facetted graph is generated when the user chooses yes for "facet?".
